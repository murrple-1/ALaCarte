# A La Carte
## About the Program
This program is was a school project that I have cleaned up for portfolio
purposes. It was a early attempt to write a GUI interface using the Swing library
and using XML for data storage and retrieval.  
The program reads from an XML file to display searchable recipes, which can be added
to and saved later.  

## Installation
This archive comes packaged with the binaries, since they are platform-independent.
In order to run it, you must have a Java VM installed. To recompile the program, 
you must have  a Java compiler installed. Either the official Oracle/Sun
version, or the GCC variant is recommended.  
I recommend also using [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) for viewing, editing and
compiling.

## Running the Program
The program is run through a command line interface. The general form is 
```sh
java RecipeBrowser
```
Alternatively, you can run the program from within Eclipse.
